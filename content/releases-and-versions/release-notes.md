### Support for macOS and Linux apps

Building Flutter desktop apps for macOS and Linux is now supported on Codemagic, see instructions [here](../building/building-for-the-desktop). You can also watch a [demo](https://blog.codemagic.io/codemagic-ci-cd-releases-support-for-flutter-desktop/) of building a desktop app on Codemagic and installing and running it on macOS.

## August 2019

### Codemagic community documentation

We made Codemagic documentation public! Codemagic users are now welcome to contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/codemagic-docs/).

The improved documentation site includes:

* [Release notes](./release-notes) for an overview of latest Codemagic feature releases

* [Common issues](../troubleshooting/common-issues) together with solutions to overcome them

* [Software and versions](./versions) page containing a list of software that is available out-of-the-box

### Automatic builds on tag creation -- GitLab and Bitbucket

In addition to GitHub apps, we now support automatic builds on tag creation also for GitLab and Bitbucket apps. Whenever you create a tag via UI or using command line, Codemagic will automatically pick up and build the tagged commit. Read more about it [here](../building/automatic-build-triggering/#build-triggers).
