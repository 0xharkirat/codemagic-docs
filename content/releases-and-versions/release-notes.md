### Codemagic community documentation

We made Codemagic documentation public! Codemagic users are welcome to contribute on [GitHub](https://github.com/codemagic-ci-cd/codemagic-docs/).

The improved documentation site includes:

* [Release notes]() for an overview of latest Codemagic feature releases

* [Common issues]() together with solutions to overcome them

* [Software and versions]() page containing a list of software that is available out-of-the-box
