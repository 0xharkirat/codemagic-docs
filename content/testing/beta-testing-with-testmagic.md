Codemagic is seamlessly integrated with [Testmagic](https://testmagic.io/), a simple mobile app for viewing, testing and distributing your Codemagic builds. You can download it from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.nevercode.testmagic&hl=en) for Android and request the app download link for iOS via the #testmagic channel in our [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/flutterci/shared_invite/enQtNDcwODIzMjM4MzI2LWJhNWRkMjZlMjk1YzgzNGUwZjQ5NmUxYTI3YjQzODdlMGU1Nzg5OWQ3NGM3NDdhNGIyNjY1YTUzZTgyNTJkMTc).

With Testmagic, you can:

- Instantly get notified when a build is finished on Codemagic
- Download app binaries on your device
- Report feedback and screenshots about the build back to Codemagic
- View the reported feedback in the build overview on Codemagic
- Distribute app binaries by sharing a download link
