You can sign up with your [GitHub](https://github.com/), [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) account.

On signup, Codemagic asks for **read/write** permission to access your repository and create webhooks for automatic building. You will need to authorize Codemagic in order to connect your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account to your Codemagic account.

## Connecting several repository accounts

You can connect several repository accounts (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) with one Codemagic account.

1. Log in to Codemagic with the account you signed up.
2. Click on your account avatar at the bottom left and open **User settings**.
3. In the **Integrations** section, click **Connect** next to the account you would like to connect to Codemagic.

Once you have connected another account to your Codemagic account, you can log in to Codemagic with either of these accounts. Email notifications with build status reports will be sent to the email address thatâ€™s connected with the repository from which you build.
