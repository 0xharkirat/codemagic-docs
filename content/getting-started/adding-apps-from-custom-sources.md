You can add apps from other public or private Git-based repositories. This includes repositories requiring **SSH key authentication**. Click **Add app from custom source** on the Applications page to get started.

Then, fill in all the required fields.

1. Enter the checkout URL of the repository.
2. If a private key is required to access the repository or any private submodules in it, upload the **SSH private key** file.
3. If the SSH key is password-protected, youâ€™ll be also asked to enter the **SSH key password**.
4. Click **Add app**.

Your app will be then listed on the Applications page and you can immediately start running builds.
